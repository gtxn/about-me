                        I‚Äôm currently a student studying at Hwa Chong Institution, and I‚Äôm 18 this year (although if you
                        played the game you would know thatü§™&nbsp). In school, I like to participate actively in as
                        many
                        things
                        as I can because I genuinely love experiencing new things. For example, one of the bravest
                        things
                        I‚Äôve done is taking 2 sports CCAs in JC, Table Tennis and Floorball. I risked everything and
                        truly
                        decided to be that fish that stubbornly chooses to swim upstreamüê†and put aside everything to
                        pursue
                        this new sport that gave me so much adrenaline and excitement. And I have to say it was worth
                        it.ü•≥ By
                        God‚Äôs grace, I was given the honour to serve as the captain of floorball, and also got elected
                        into
                        Hwa Chong CCA Council! After reading this, you‚Äôll either think I‚Äôm ridiculously brave or
                        ridiculously stupidü§™. Either way, I have God and my friends and family to thank for getting
                        this
                        far,
                        and by no means was it my own effort that enabled me to experience so many different things.

                        and
                        listening to music. Music is also something that helps me focus while drowning out the other
                        noises
                        to zero in on the tasks at hand. Music is magical in that way, it helps me stay productive and
                        relax
                        all at the same time. On top of that, there‚Äôs music to match every mood, and a tune fit for
                        every
                        circumstance :D</p>

                        Last but definitely not least, I am also deeply interested in math and science (I try not to be
                        a
                        nerd about itüòî). I was lucky enough to be accepted in the Science Math Talent Programme in Hwa
                        Chong, and being with a group of people as geeky as I am made me realise that I really do have a
                        passion for these subjects. However, one particular field has my special attention, the apple
                        of
                        my science eye... computer programming! Seeing lines of code produce beautiful (and sometimes
                        not so
                        beautiful) results is exhilarating. Like a carpenter who builds furniture with his hands, I
                        aspire to be a
                        programmer who builds solutions with her code. This element of solving real problems is what got
                        me
                        in love with Hackathonsü•≥ and I‚Äôve been blessed enough to have gotten to know like minded people
                        that share my passion, and we have embarked on different Hackathon as a team. For example, we
                        built
                        a water management system, making use of machine learning and object detection to calculate the
                        amount of water flowing out of a tap to help people accurately track their water usage without
                        complicated installation. This was my first ever Hackathon, and it was super memorable. It
                        could‚Äôve
                        been the severe lack of sleep, the coffee, or the overdose of chips and sugar that we consumed,
                        but
                        I left the Hackathon super high, and super duper proud of what we had accomplished, knowing that
                        our solution had the
                        potential
                        to do some good to this world. And the added bonus was that our solution won 2nd place in the
                        IMDA
                        Xtreme apps Hackathon:D

                        Last year, we also took part in the AWS Build On Hackathon and this experience deserves a whole
                        paragraph
                        of its own. It was during our Block Test season, and we were stressed trying to juggle all the
                        work
                        we had to do. I won‚Äôt go too much into the technicalities of our solution lest I bore you (if I
                        haven't done so already HAHA), but we built a
                        Visitor
                        Management System for hospitals to help them in the season of COVID19 to ease their additional
                        responsibilities following the pandemic. This was memorable because we worked very hard on our
                        solution, forgoing precious time for revision and having major CRISES over whether we would be
                        able to finish the 745892323448 stacks of work that we (rather readily) abandoned for our
                        project. Our
                        hard
                        work paid off, and we managed to build a full system in about a month. We were also rewarded
                        with
                        the Most Innovative award, Audience Award, and 2nd place. My block test results on the other
                        hand ..... AHAHA I'll leave that to your imagination üëâüëà
